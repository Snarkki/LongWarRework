# LongWarRework
Personal classes for LWotc. Some classes might have abilities created by the mod or from shadow op perk pack. LWotc is necessary anyways. 
This disables base classes from LWotc. 

It also has some other settings on the balance, based on the mods im running. So delete the inis if you want to just use the classes.
